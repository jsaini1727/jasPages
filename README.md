## User Story
```md
AS A social media startup
I made an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle 
large amounts of unstructured data.
```

## Description
```md
I developed a social network API and when I enter the command to invoke the application, 
my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts the data for each of these 
routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. Finally when 
I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia I am able to successfully create and delete reactions 
to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
```

## Technology
```md
The application uses various technologies associated with noSql database namely MongoDB, 
tools like Mongoose, insomnia and nodemon along with the conventional tools of node modules.
